# AutoDruckSelos

Simple java implementation of a print folder.
Each file which is placed in a specific folder will be printed.

Used for automated printing of the grouptables and gamesheets for the volleyball tournament Rasenbeach (www.rasenbeach.at).

The code searches for two printers (see Printer.java) and registers a watch folder.
Depending on the folder and the file name the file will be printed to the correct printer in the specific paper size.
